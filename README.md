## ACME(Next Js) Dashboard with Firestore Database

This repository contains the code for a dashboard built with Next.js. The project was initially based on Vercel's starter tutorial, with some key enhancements. Notably, the authentication system was switched from NextAuth to Firebase Authentication, and Firestore was integrated to support a new page added to the application.
